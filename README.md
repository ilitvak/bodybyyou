What is BodyByYou? 
----------------
This is a nutrition/educational website to inform people of the various benefits or eating healthy. The website covers multiple areas from food types, fats, carbs, proteins, to shopping lists, to motivational quotes to get your pumped! This website means a lot to me because it emcompases a lot of my daily life and the effort that is required to eat well. Everyone can eat well or not, sometimes you just need a little direction on how to do that. This is what BodyByYou does. It gives the user a thorough look on food suggestions and how to shop smart. Key Note: I am not a nutritionist, but I am a certified personal trainer, so all of the food recommendations/portion sizes are my own suggestions based on copious amounts of research. Enjoy!
